# Fatigue calculations done in python

This directory contains the RULe method calculations of fatigue damage lookup tables. 

The order of the scripts is shown in the workflow image below.

Note that it is needed to add the simulation force and moment time series result binary files and other design data into the data/ directiory. It is not tracked on github due to confidentiality.

This method outputs data into output/ directory. If not already existing, it will create the dir for you.
